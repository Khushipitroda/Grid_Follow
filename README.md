# Grid Follow

The sole purpose of this repository is to give a clear understanding on how to implement an advanced Grid follow robot using arduino or PIC programming.
Since it is a bit difficult to debug and test in actual devices, and not having proper guidelines for the beginners on how to develop the code from scratch, I decided to create this repo for the people who need guidelines, in C++. All the code here is written using comments as much as possible for clear understanding.

So I have divided the Grid Follow to 3 different phases as,
1. Grid scanning and saving to EEPROM. (scannig_grid.cpp)
2. Find the shortest path using EEPROM data.
3. Navigate through the shortest path.


The following codes are not finalized. Iâ€™m not responsible for any damages caused using these pieces of codes.
